# CLearn is a Machine Learning Library written in C

---

## :bulb: About
CLearn's goal is to not only facilitate the usage of Machine Learning models in C but also provide a general understanding of the algorithms with clear documentation, focusing on the **educational** aspect.  

#### :pushpin: From the Author
This repository is simply following my learning of ML algorithms and the implentations may not be the most efficient in terms of logic but are just basic to provide a more clear understanding. This project is under [LICENSE](LICENSE.md)

## :file_folder: Contents

1. [Linear Regression Model](./Regression/LinearRegression)

## Contributions

Anyone is free to contribute but must have the following requirements:
1. Clear documentation of the algorithm including the mathematical aspects.
2. Only the source code and header files should be included ignoring any compiled binaries.
3. Test cases to test the model.

I hope this repository helps people learn and gain a basic understanding of the machine learning models and their implementations.
